# Student Record Management System (C)

A menu-driven backend application developed in C to manage student records using
structures and file handling.

## Features
- Add student records
- View all student records
- Search student by roll number
- Delete student record
- Persistent storage using binary files

## Technologies Used
- C Programming
- File Handling
- Structures
- Pointers
- Standard I/O

## How It Works
- Student data is stored in a binary file (`students.dat`)
- Records are written using `fwrite()` and read using `fread()`
- Searching is done using sequential file access
- Deletion is handled using a temporary file approach

## Sample Menu
1.Add Student
2.View Students
3.Search Student
4.Delete Student

## Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on experience with file handling in C
- Understanding backend data flow
- Debugging logical and runtime errors
- Implementing real-world CRUD operations
